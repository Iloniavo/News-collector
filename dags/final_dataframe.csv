Here's what we know about VinFast and its push to make it in the crowded EV market: VinFast is Vietnam's first homegrown car manufacturer. It has launched two electric vehicle models in North America, becoming the first-ever Vietnamese car sold in the US market. It hopes to compete with giants such as Tesla and it began building a factory in the US state of North Carolina last month. The carmaker is a subsidiary of Vietnam's largest private conglomerate, Vingroup, which is owned by the country's richest man, Pham Nhat Vuong. Vuong started out selling dried noodles in the former Soviet Union before amassing a $5 billion fortune from enterprises in a range of sectors including real estate, tourism and education. Once his focus shifted to cars with the launch of VinFast in 2017, he transformed a muddy patch of swampland near northern Vietnam's port city of Haiphong into a state-of-the-art factory within two years. The factory was kitted out with 1,200 robots, German, Japanese and Swedish machinery, and a global team from auto giants including BMW and General Motors. However, in 2022 VinFast posted a loss of $2.1 billion. Shares of VinFast -- trading under the ticker ""VFS"" -- entered the market Tuesday at $22 and rose sharply, closing at more than $37. That gave it a market value of around $85 billion after the day's trade, much higher than Ford's $48 billion valuation and General Motor's $46 billion. Vuong's wealth jumped by $39 billion, according to Bloomberg. He owns about 99 percent of the company's shares, meaning only a small number are being actively traded which makes them prone to big price swings. As a way to get the company listed in the United States, VinFast completed a merger with casino mogul Lawrence Ho's Black Spade Acquisition. Black Spade is a ""blank cheque"" company, or a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) introduced to public markets with the sole purpose of merging with an operating company. Some companies using SPACs -- including other EV startups -- have suffered big market drops. VinFast launched its electric vehicles last year across Vietnam, where they are slowly gaining in popularity. It also introduced a taxi service in major cities in April using the EVs. In North America, more than 10,000 orders for two models -- the VF8 and the VF9 -- had been placed by customers, VinFast told AFP Wednesday. But only 350 cars -- all of them VF8s -- are currently on the road. VinFast hopes the factory in North Carolina will begin production in 2025, and has also opened showrooms in Canada and Europe. VinFast has more than 10,000 orders for its EVs in North America but only 350 are currently on the road - all VF-8 models (pictured) AFP REGISTER FOR FREE to continue reading ✔️ Unlock the full content of International Business Times UK for free offer available for a limited time only ✔️ Easily manage your Newsletters subscriptions and save your favourite articles ✔️ No payment method required Already have an account?

A war of words broke out among the technology billionaires as reports about Twitter’s (rebranded as X) rival emerged. With Meta’s launch of Threads in July, the heated exchange reached a new level. Based on the verbal spat, it was Musk, 39, who challenged the Meta owner to the mixed martial arts fight. Zuck, 52, while accepting the challenge, asked for the fight venue by posting a ‘Send me the location’ along with the screenshot of Musk’s tweet. The X-owner, however, accused Zuck of not accepting the duel. Interestingly, Musk has now announced that, in the recap of the events, he joked about the fight to begin with. He captioned the post, “Fight Recap: I joked on X about fighting Zuck.” Check out Musk’s post: Fight Recap: I joked on X about fighting Zuck Zuck then said “SEND ME LOCATION” Italy graciously offered a Colosseum Related Articles Elon Musk brags about lifting '45 lb weights' before cage fight, Zuckerberg says 'not holding breath' Mark Zuckerberg on Elon Musk's cage fight claim: 'You'll hear it from me' Zuck declined I suggested his home as “safe space” Tragically, he was ahem “traveling” Is there anywhere he will fight? https://t.co/gpcRLW49fv — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 15, 2023 The post amassed over 2.65 crore views.

Luxury electric vehicle maker Lucid contributed ""just 16% of the increase despite representing 24% of the portfolio,"" the fund tracker said on Tuesday. ""Lucid continued to drag down the fund's US public holdings with q-o-q growth of 6.2% to US$9.47 billion – a level that was still 45.6% down on end-June 2022."" The remainder of its holdings were up 10.7% from the previous quarter to $29.46 billion, beating the S&P 500 Index's 8.3% rise over the same period, Global SWF said. The holdings ex-Lucid were 25.9% higher year-on-year. PIF, which manages about $700 billion in assets, boosted its Lucid stake by 24% after it contributed nearly two-thirds of a $3 billion capital raise. There were otherwise minor changes to its portfolio. The fund made a total comprehensive loss of 58.545 billion riyals ($15.61 billion) last year, according to a recent annual report. That was mainly ""due to the unrealized losses (change in fair value) of investments in Softbank Vision Fund in addition to losses of other investment due to market downturn particularly in tech sector,"" the annual report said. PIF boosted the weight in the U.S. portfolio of its retail and consumer holdings, including gaming, by 39% and tech's weight rose to 16%. Retail and gaming was up 15% and tech 18% in terms of value, Global SWF said. PIF has overall invested $5.4 billion in Lucid, the carmaker said in a second-quarter presentation. Lucid is building its first overseas factory in Saudi Arabia and electric vehicles are part of a vast economic agenda known as Vision 2030 to wean the economy off oil. ""The EV manufacturer has struggled with mounting losses and tightening cash reserves due to recession risks and a price war with its bigger rival Tesla, which has undermined PIF's otherwise successful US equities holdings,"" Global SWF said. ""By bringing Lucid back into its full ownership, PIF could better align the carmaker with its vision."" ($1 = 3.7505 riyals) (Reporting by Yousef Saba; Editing by Conor Humphries)"

83,channelnewsasia,Unknown,Vietnam's VinFast faces stern EV sales test to retain eye-popping valuation,Unknown,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/vietnams-vinfast-faces-stern-ev-sales-test-retain-eye-popping-valuation-3702506,Unknown,2023-08-16T03:08:44Z,"Best News Website or Mobile Service WAN-IFRA Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 Best News Website or Mobile Service Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 HANOI : Vietnam's EV champion VinFast has managed to sell Wall Street on a Nasdaq listing that values the loss-making startup at more than $85 billion, almost twice as much as Ford or General Motors. Now comes the hard part: moving overseas growth out of the slow lane. VinFast needs to deliver more than twice the sales notched up so far this year in the remaining five months to hit a stretch annual target set by its founder of selling 50,000 EVs. For that, it needs to complete a revamp of a sales strategy to bring in distributors and dealers rather than selling through its own platform alone, an approach it borrowed from Tesla. It will also require bringing costs down to compete on price with the likes of Tesla, which has been using its scale and industry-leading margins to cut prices and pile pressure on rivals since the start of the year. Shares of dedicated EV maker VinFast, which merged with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Black Spade, surged on their Nasdaq debut on Tuesday. Since 99 per cent of the company is controlled by VinFast's founder, Pham Nhat Vuong, the stock's tiny float makes it subject to more volatility. Other EV SPAC deals, including Lucid, which Black Spade used as the basis of its initial $23 billion valuation of VinFast, have seen their shares tumble after listing. Lucid is valued now at under $15 billion, nearly 40 per cent less than its $24 billion SPAC valuation in 2021. VinFast's intent to raise additional capital is also a potential threat to its lofty valuation. CFO David Mansfield said on Tuesday the company was talking to a range of investors, including sovereign wealth funds, and was on track to raise additional funding in the next 18 months. ""Like any transaction, pricing is set by the market,"" CEO Le Thi Thu Thuy told Reuters when asked about the terms of a future investment. ""So it's not like we can say that you use our equity or stock (price) today."" The VinFast listing creates a way for the automaker, which has struggled to retain senior executives, to offer share-based compensation, a prospect spelled out in its filings. BRINGING IN PARTNERS VinFast CEO Thuy said on Tuesday the EV maker would be shifting to a new ""hybrid model"" for sales, bringing in distributors and dealers for overseas markets. Since it announced its overseas expansion plans, VinFast had been counting on just using its own showrooms, like Tesla does. ""Opening our own stores is great but it takes a lot of time,"" she said. ""Joining forces with other partners to go faster has always been our nature."" VinFast opened 122 showrooms globally as of June, the company said, concentrated on the U.S. West Coast. Founder Vuong had said in May that VinFast could sell 50,000 EVs this year. Through the first seven months, it has sold over 16,000, including its sales in Vietnam. That includes sales of just 137 of its VF8 model in the United States, the only model it currently sells there. “The ballpark numbers that our chairman indicated for this year are still on track,” CFO Mansfield said. Even at that target, VinFast will be only selling at roughly a sixth of the production capacity it has at its Haiphong, Vietnam plant. A new plant is under construction in North Carolina and scheduled to begin operations in 2025. Consultancy AlixPartners has said it estimates EV makers need annual sales of 400,000 vehicles to break even, including in China, where most are losing money in a deepening price war for market share. Pricing is another challenge and Tesla has kept the pressure on, introducing a cheaper version of its Model S and Model X on Tuesday. The Tesla Model Y is almost $7,000 cheaper than VinFast's VF8 after including federal subsidies. Thuy said VinFast believed its products were priced competitively but was working to bring prices down. ""There is no other (automaker) in the world that has as low a cost base as in Vietnam,"" she said. ""All of that is leading to cost reduction in the future.""

The introduction of the Model S and Model X Standard Range was spotted on Tesla’s online configurator, reports Teslarati. On Tesla’s official website, the Model S Standard Range is now priced at $78,490 before options. The Model S SR offers a range of 320 miles of range per charge and a 3.7-second, 0-60 mph time. The vehicle also features a top speed of 149 miles per hour. The Tesla Model X Standard Range is now offered at a starting price of $88,490 before options. The users could acquire the all-electric SUV that features a range of 269 miles per charge and a 0-60 mph time of 4.4 seconds. The Model S SR and Model X SR provide a lower entry point for the two Tesla flagship EVs. “At less than $80,000 for the Model S SR and less than $90,000 for the Model X Standard Range, the vehicles could very well be a steal deal,"" said the report. Unlike Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, which are eligible for a $7,500 US tax credit, the S and X receive no discounts. The company has reduced prices of its cars in the past to sell more units. Tesla reported a revenue of $25 billion with a net income of $2.7 billion (up 20 per cent year-on-year) in the second quarter (Q2) this year. In the second quarter, Tesla produced nearly 480,000 vehicles and delivered over 466,000 vehicles. “For 2023, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term 50 per cent CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year,” according to Tesla’s earnings report. “We are focusing on cost reduction, new product development that will enable future growth, investments in R&D, better vehicle financing options, continuous product improvement and generation of free cash flow,” said Tesla."

88,bbc,Unknown,VinFast: Vietnam EV maker valued at more than Ford or GM,The share sale on the Nasdaq values VinFast at $85bn compared to Ford's $48bn and GM's $46bn.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66517549?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,Unknown,2023-08-16T00:29:00Z,"VinFast: Vietnam EV maker valued at more than Ford or GM Published 2 hours ago Share close panel Share page Copy link About sharing Image source, Getty Images By Mariko Oi Business reporter Vietnamese electric vehicle (EV) maker VinFast's stock market valuation has soared above Ford and General Motors (GM) on its first day of trading. Shares in the firm, which has yet to make a profit, closed above $37 (£29) each in their New York's debut. That gave VinFast a stock market valuation of $85bn, much higher than Ford's $48bn and GM's $46bn. It comes as motor industry giants and newer manufacturers fight for a slice of the booming EV market. The listing added around $39bn to the wealth of VinFast's chairman and founder Pham Nhat Vuong, who was already Vietnam's richest man. Regulatory filings show he controls 99% of the firm's outstanding shares, mostly through Vietnam's largest conglomerate, Vingroup JSC. That limits the number of shares available for other investors to trade, which can lead to large price swings. Trading in VinFast was relatively thin on Tuesday, with around $185m worth of its shares changing hands. ""Investors are continuing to believe that the future is in electric and that a low-cost East Asian country will emerge as a competitor in the US,"" said Bill Russo, Founder and CEO of Shanghai-based Automobility. ""The markets believe that given geopolitics that Vietnam, not China, will be that country."" Instead of a conventional share sale, VinFast went public using a shell company, or special purpose acquisition company (Spac). Spacs are often used by start-ups to speed up the often slow and expensive process of taking a private company public. In simple terms, it means merging a company that is not on a stock exchange with one that is. Several EV makers - including Lordstown Motors and Faraday Future - have gone public using Spacs in the last three years. However, both firms have lost more than 90% of their stock market value since their mergers. Mr Russo said VinFast could be different because ""they are primarily backed by Vingroup, which gives them access to funding from a business that has a proven track record of growth"". ""Most EV start-ups fail because they do not have profitable core and external funding eventually runs out as they burn capital far faster than they generate cash,"" he said. But VinFast also faces tough competition as major players fight for market domination. Market leaders - including Elon Musk's Tesla and BYD, which is backed by veteran investor Warren Buffett - have been cutting prices to boost sales. In the first half of the year VinFast delivered 11,300 EVs, according to a company presentation . By comparison, Tesla delivered more than 889,000 vehicles in the same period. ""Tesla will continue to be the clear leader in EVs but there will be many winners,"" said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. ""VinFast has built a strong foundation for EV success.""
